If you want all your games to be recorded, each in its own file,
use this command, which will make a persistent setting:
 * /seta cl_autoRecordDemo 1
 * play a demo: \demo <name>
 * increase slot nymber: \sv_maxclients 500
 * \map_restart
 * /team - Makes you join the game or spectate
 * \team r - enters the game in the red team
When you are spectating, if you press "ATTACK" button (usually, left
mouse click), you begin "follow" spectate mode (seeing in first
person for the point of view of another player), and clicking again
you cycle between players. If you pres "USE_ITEM" (ENTER key by
default), you switch to "free" spectate mode again (your "virtual
camera" can "fly" around the arena as you wish).

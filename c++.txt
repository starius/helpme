#define private friend class Hack; private
Notes:
If class Hack and target class are from different namespaces,
then class Hack must be declared before target class definition,
and class name in friend-statement should be prepended  with namespaces

Concepts are likely to be presented by keyword "typename"
(parameters of templates or new types, created by template code)
used as type replacements for compile-time duck typing.

logical_cast:
    throws for references
    returns 0 for pointers

Caller graphs and profiling:
    valgrind --tool=callgrind
    kcachegrind for view

Programs with type errors will not even compile, much less run.

Rule of Three: http://stackoverflow.com/a/4172724
If you need to explicitly declare either the destructor,
copy constructor or copy assignment operator yourself,
you probably need to explicitly declare all three of them.

Rule of 4, 5: http://stackoverflow.com/a/4782927

A a1;
A a2 = a; // calls copy constructor, not assignment operator!

Matching against the function or method signature:

    #include <string>
    #include <iostream>

    struct C {
        double b(std::string a) {
            return 2.5;
        }
    };

    template<typename C, typename G, typename F>
    struct Wrapper {
    public:
        typedef G (C::*M) (F);

        template<M m>
        struct Inner {
            G operator()(C& r, F f) {
                return ((&r)->*m)(f);
            }
        };
    };

    Wrapper<C, double, std::string>::Inner<&C::b> w;
    double res = w (c, "A”);
